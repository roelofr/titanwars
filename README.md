## Workshop addons
I've scoured the workshop for addons which can be used to enhance the realism of
the game. These will probably be:

 - [BF 2142 - EU Recon Player Model](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=262315922)
 - [Battlefield 2142 Playermodels](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=295394050)
 - Rest of the models need to be ported, done by hand or should be using alternatives from HL2 or something
